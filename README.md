- React
- Typescript
- MUI5
- date-fns
- swiper
- zustand

- react-if (better readability)

## Backend

- Laravel (PHP)

# Review by the team leader

I enjoyed working with typescript on this project. I was already using typescript before, but i realized typesafety was even more crucial in this project. Having separated backend/frontend technology forced me to type the requests results. React-query helped so much and also using that neubrutalism design that i like a lot. I discovered react-if quite recently, it didn't run as expected honestly so i kinda gave up this library but i'll take a more deep look into it so my code become more readable. Animations with framer motion were made quite quickly, it adds more interactions with the user and is very smooth in page transitions. Not every feature was developed because of a lack of time. We should have develop more the mockups in Figma as well, it was a bit harder without it being clear.
